# Traffic-sign-classification
Traffic sign classification is the process of identifying and recognizing traffic signs in digital images or video footage. This is typically done using computer vision techniques, such as image processing and machine learning.The goal of traffic sign classification is to automatically detect and classify traffic signs in real-world scenarios, such as on roads or in traffic cameras.

There are several different approaches to traffic sign classification, including traditional image processing techniques and machine learning based methods. Traditional image processing techniques involve using features such as color, shape, and texture to classify traffic signs. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, use algorithms such as neural networks to learn to recognize traffic signs based on training data.

The data set used for the classification is very important and it should be diverse and representative of different traffic signs, lighting conditions, and weather conditions.

Traffic sign classification systems are used in a variety of applications, such as self-driving cars, intelligent transportation systems, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). They play an important role in helping to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents caused by human error.
